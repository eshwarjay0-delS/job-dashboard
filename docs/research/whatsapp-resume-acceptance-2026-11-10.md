# WhatsApp resume hold — exact source recovery and evidence boundary

Updated: 10 November 2026. Method: read-only Library, Gmail, GitHub and database review plus local DOCX metadata/text inspection. No model call, real email, WhatsApp send, R2 write, or production mutation was performed.

## Recovered 17 October incident

The archived Library screenshot was created at `2026-10-17T22:28:39Z` (5:28 PM America/Chicago). It shows the M Fit WhatsApp thread:

- At about 5:25 PM, a Security Engineer – Risk & Controls job post and a five-page, 28 KB Word resume were submitted.
- At 5:28 PM, the bot replied: “The rewrite did not reach your 98% coverage target after automatic repair. I have held the file.”
- The visible missing-term list was `ccsp`, `cism`, `crisc`, `cisa`, `canton`, `sol`, `specialty`, `attributes`.

### Original resume bytes recovered

The exact input DOCX was recovered from a private Library archive. It is 27,724 bytes; its digest was verified locally and is retained with the private artifact, not published in this repository. This is the original source file, not a generated output.

### Full job description recovered

The complete JD was recovered from the matching forwarded message in the user's private inbox. Its title, location, contract type and opening requirements match the screenshot.

The JD requires a bachelor's degree; 5+ years in cybersecurity, technology risk, information security, risk management or controls governance; risk assessments and control evaluations; remediation through closure; NIST, ISO 27001, CIS Controls or COBIT; AWS/Azure/GCP; IAM, secrets, encryption and key management; audit/compliance support; and analytical, problem-solving and communication skills.

Preferred items include blockchain, smart contracts, cryptography and DLT platforms (Ethereum, Hyperledger Besu, Canton, Solana, Polygon); SSDLC/DevSecOps; vulnerability management/security testing; Archer, ServiceNow GRC and MetricStream; risk metrics/dashboards/executive reporting; CI/CD and cloud-native controls; CISSP/CISM/CRISC/CISA/CCSP; and AWS Security Specialty.

## Evidence classification of the eight screenshot terms

- `CCSP`, `CISM`, `CRISC`, `CISA`, and `AWS Security Specialty` are certifications. The current canonical keyword pipeline intentionally excludes certifications from match targets and removes certifications absent from the source. Do not add them to raise coverage.
- `Canton` and `Solana` are preferred blockchain platforms. The recovered source resume does not show them; they remain unsupported and must not be written as candidate experience.
- `sol` is not a separate JD skill. The full JD says `Solana`; do not count the truncated fragment separately.
- `attributes` does not appear in the recovered JD as a skill or qualification. It is generic extraction noise and must not hold a resume below its target.

A source-backed regression in this PR adds `sol` and `attributes` to the generic/non-skill filter and tests the incident's certification and preferred-platform boundaries. It does not lower evidence gates or add unsupported skills.

## Important source conflict — owner reconciliation required

The recovered source DOCX contains education, employment-date and credential claims that conflict with the owner-confirmed profile already available in prior conversations. The conflict affects the JD's required 5+ years and some credentials. Do not count the conflicting dates, tenure or credentials as confirmed experience, merge the two timelines, or rewrite them until the owner reconciles the source. The file is evidence of what was uploaded, not proof that every claim is current and verified.

A separate Library resume artifact is not accepted as the incident output: its document fingerprint differs, its core document timestamps predate the incident, and there is no request ID, R2 key or Meta receipt linking it to this run.

## Current policy and release state

The old 98% hard WhatsApp hold is superseded by the owner-approved 6 November channel policy in `src/lib/whatsapp-resume-acceptance.ts` and `docs/research/whatsapp-scored-rewrite-2026-11-06.md`:

- Web downloads retain the strict 95% raw-JD-overlap gate.
- WhatsApp may send a completed, readable 70–94.9% raw-overlap DOCX with disclosed gaps when supported coverage is at least 95% and all clean-pass checks hold.
- A finished readable result below 70% may be sent with gaps disclosed, but is not a clean pass.
- Incomplete, skills-only, unreadable, failed or identity-mismatched rewrites use the selected same-account resume fallback.
- Unsupported experience, credentials, employers, dates and metrics are never invented.

PR #267's DOCX body/header/footer/hyperlink identity repair is already merged in master. The current canonical production alias `job-dashboard-fawn.vercel.app` is READY at `a66c108bff6175149c4aadd882ab11128445b8cc` on deployment `dpl_7gjdfRFeLjqcPdVC52NkaEatugKA`. Master has since advanced to `48ca317b0c59215fd112d854f61dc71828f29d69` with PR #276's contract classifier and PR #282's evidence-separated resume gap report, but that newer master is not in production because Vercel reports `build-rate-limit`. The deployed alias proves the source-boundary fix is live, not that the historical WhatsApp run succeeded.

## Remaining blockers and acceptance

1. The original DOCX and full JD are now recovered, but the generated output for this exact run is still missing.
2. The per-run R2 object key, webhook/request correlation ID, Meta message ID and signed delivery/read receipt are unavailable.
3. iZap currently has no connected WhatsApp number and returns no matching chat/message history for the incident. The original thread cannot be replayed through iZap.
4. The source DOCX conflicts with previously confirmed profile facts. Owner reconciliation is required before any experience/tenure claim is used.
5. No live WhatsApp send or authenticated device test was performed. Historical delivery remains unverified.

Next: keep the conflicting source facts quarantined until owner reconciliation; obtain the exact generated output and per-run R2/webhook/Meta trace plus signed delivery/read receipt before an authorized exact-source replay. Report raw overlap, supported coverage, unsupported requirements and document integrity separately. Do not restore the old 98% hard hold or send a real WhatsApp test without explicit authorization.


## 10 November 2026 — source-boundary regression released

PR #273 merged from exact head `5b6ad44a2f0bdea15678ecc9ea5b6469a6212463` as `a66c108bff6175149c4aadd882ab11128445b8cc`. The full CI run 42761112788 and Kompas baseline 42761112810 both completed SUCCESS. Production deployment `dpl_7gjdfRFeLjqcPdVC52NkaEatugKA` is READY at the exact merge SHA and independently confirmed on the canonical alias `job-dashboard-fawn.vercel.app`.

The deployed change excludes the screenshot-only `sol` and `specialty` fragments and generic `attributes` noise from match targets. It preserves supported NIST/ISO/AWS/Azure terms, keeps certifications and unsupported preferred Canton/Solana platforms out of candidate claims, and adds explicit source-fact conflict rules: conflicting education, employment dates, tenure or credential status stay unresolved until the candidate corrects them; JD requirements and years of experience are never candidate evidence.

This is source-backed code and deployment evidence only. It does not prove a 98% live match, exact historical replay, DOCX delivery or Meta handset delivery. The generated output, R2 key, webhook correlation ID, Meta message ID and signed delivery/read receipt remain unavailable. The source DOCX conflicts with owner-confirmed profile facts and requires reconciliation before any affected claim is used. No model call, real email, WhatsApp send, R2 write or production mutation was performed. The old 98% hard hold remains superseded by the 6 Nov channel-specific policy.

Next: reconcile the source facts and obtain the exact output/trace before an authorized replay; then verify document integrity and delivery separately. Do not send a live WhatsApp test without explicit authorization.


## 10 November 2026 — separate recovery-root error under repair

A separate 9 November runtime error reported by PR #278 is `That file is outside your resume library` from the authenticated recovery route. This is not evidence that the original 17 October request reached this recovery path. Source review found a plausible root mismatch: an uploaded DOCX is first held in the sender's inbox and copied to that user's durable Files library; a later retry can switch to the durable path while `generate()` still defaults to the inbox root when the original job has no `Files` selection context.

PR #278 adds `resolveRecoveryResumeContext` and passes the validated root into `generate()`. It accepts only the authenticated user's library root or that sender's inbox root, replaces stale serialized Files roots with the current user root, validates the selected email folder when Files metadata exists, and fails closed for invalid user IDs, sibling-account paths, wrong email folders, stale Files metadata on inbox paths and arbitrary paths. It does not bypass the tailor's path-containment checks.

The first full-CI attempt on head `a67659e11f45edcb5f717bddc639ca36336e9fc7` failed because `scripts/tests/whatsapp-recovery-durability.test.mjs` still asserted the former `job.files` argument. The assertion was corrected in commit `3782c97dea69a8632135586bdb8296ad1790c781` to verify that path resolution occurs before a fail-closed `source_outside_account` rejection and that the validated Files context/root are passed into the tailor.

Current exact-head evidence for PR #278: full CI `42773757901`, WhatsApp recovery regression `42773757620`, and Kompas baseline `42773757574` all completed SUCCESS. Preview deployment `dpl_Hp9we2LBxgp9bNqup8rMVEdgoM8a` is READY at the exact head, target preview only. The separate Kompas voice preview HTTP gate `42773754013` failed and remains owned by the Voice Delivery task. PR #274's identity-sensitive owner-review gate remains open; no production deployment, real model generation, R2 write or WhatsApp send occurred.

Release is held: PR #274's unconditional identity guard is security/identity-sensitive, has green CI/recovery/baseline checks, but no user-authored approval for that exact behavior was found in accessible prior context. PR #278 must not ship alone before that owner-review gate is resolved. No actual handset delivery is claimed; a signed Meta delivered/read callback is required.


## 10 November 2026 — recovery-root exact-head gates completed

PR #278 head `3782c97dea69a8632135586bdb8296ad1790c781` now passes full CI `42773757901`, WhatsApp recovery regression `42773757620`, and Kompas baseline `42773757574`. The exact-head preview `dpl_Hp9we2LBxgp9bNqup8rMVEdgoM8a` is READY. This confirms source tests and preview build only.

The canonical production alias remains on `a66c108bff6175149c4aadd882ab11128445b8cc`; no production deployment or authenticated recovery smoke was performed. The PR remains held because PR #274's stricter identity verification is security-sensitive and has no retrieved user-authored approval. The separate voice preview HTTP gate is owned by Kompas Continuous Voice Delivery. Do not ship the recovery fix alone or treat a preview build as production.

The historical 17 Oct 17:28 incident remains separately blocked by the missing generated DOCX and per-run R2/webhook/Meta trace, plus owner reconciliation of conflicting source facts. No real WhatsApp send, model generation or R2 write was performed.


## 10 November 2026 — evidence-bound send-safety proposal

A separate source audit found that `tailor.ts` still instructed the writer to place every JD term into experience and to treat the candidate as claiming the full JD, despite the existing evidence-bound keyword list. The final experience-weaving pass also used all scored JD keywords, and the Gemini-related pass did not require generated terms to appear in the source resume or explicit candidate confirmations.

The WhatsApp gate also treated `unverified_jd_terms` as an allowed shortfall. That created a mismatch: `acceptableWhatsAppResume` rejected the draft, but `whatsappRewriteUsable` could still consider it sendable. PR #279 is a DRAFT fix that:
- makes the writer prompt evidence-bound;
- limits experience weaving to source-supported `jdKwsPrompt` terms and filters Gemini-related terms against the source plus explicit first-person confirmations;
- keeps the separately labelled `Job-post terms` line, but removes unverified experience claims from the WhatsApp shortfall allow-list so the generated DOCX falls back to the same-account selected resume.

PR #279 head `cc7e4ea675d808a89f4b4ea1f22711b0be7141b7` has Kompas baseline `42775486253`, full CI `42775486431` and WhatsApp recovery regression `42775486380` in progress. This changes WhatsApp external-send behavior and remains subject to explicit owner review. No live model generation, resume write, WhatsApp send or R2 write occurred.


## 10 November 2026 — exact source archive verification and final-DOCX Gemini requirement

The original 17 Oct source DOCX was independently verified in a private Library archive (27,724 bytes; exact digest retained privately and not published). The matching JD was recovered from the user's private inbox. The source's education, employer chronology, experience length and credentials materially conflict with the owner-confirmed profile; keep those claims quarantined until reconciled. The generated output DOCX, per-run R2 object key, Meta message ID and signed delivery/read receipt remain unavailable, so no exact replay or delivery claim is made.

The owner-approved 3 Nov requirement (recorded in PR #275 at 07:46 UTC) is to ask Gemini exactly `Give me ATS score` after every final DOCX export, identify missing/weak JD keywords, correct only gaps supported by the source resume or explicit first-person confirmations, re-export and recheck until the highest truthful match. The score and suggestions are diagnostics only, never experience evidence. Current `src/lib/tailor.ts` has two pre-generation Gemini keyword passes, deterministic ATS parsing of the exported DOCX, and Gemini final-document gap feedback, but it does not perform the final-DOCX ATS-score review or bounded correction/re-export/recheck loop.

PR #279 exact head `073dd98465ac81426dcc6ec1c9ae9b4f80120e61` has full CI 42795044313, Kompas baseline 42795044640, and WhatsApp recovery regression 42795044615 all SUCCESS; it remains DRAFT and requires owner review for WhatsApp external-send behavior. Its Vercel status remains build-rate-limit. No real model call, resume write, WhatsApp send, R2 write or email send was performed.


## 13 November 2026 — current evidence recheck

The 10 November archive review recorded the 17 October source DOCX and matching JD, but the 12 November accessible Library recheck did not resolve the exact source bytes. Treat current source availability as unverified until the bytes are rechecked. The generated output DOCX, per-run R2 object/version, webhook correlation, Meta message ID and signed delivered/read receipt remain unavailable. No historical replay or resend is justified.

The 13 November Safe Merge Gate production aggregation found two rejected WhatsApp drafts in the 24-hour window, latest 12 November 18:18:32 UTC. Both had 100% raw and supported keyword coverage but remained partial, incomplete and needs-review; blockers included `draft_parts_missing`, `quality_incomplete`, `quality_not_deliverable` and `roles_unrewritten`. The new profile-part acceptance restack addresses only `draft_parts_missing`; PR #352 addresses the separate confirmed-skill cross-role boundary. Neither result proves a live 95–100% match or successful delivery.

The owner-approved 6 November channel-specific delivery policy remains authoritative. Do not restore the superseded 98% hard hold. Keep the initial no-provider fallback limited to the exact selected same-account original, labelled NOT TAILORED; swipe-reply refinement failures remain text-only and preserve the last delivered version.


## 13 November 2026 — profile-gap source gates

PR #353 `97c6fbf2caec1507059b44a1237f397263f27b95` now passes full CI, Kompas baseline, WhatsApp recovery and Plan/REA schema on its current head. It remains DRAFT because the protected preview gate has no pass; the private `KOMPAS_VERCEL_API_TOKEN` is still required. The change addresses requested profile-part acceptance only. It is not deployed and does not establish a live model result, exported DOCX quality, or WhatsApp delivery.


## 13 November 2026 — source and JD recovery (private artifacts withheld)

This run retrieved the private original 17 Oct resume bytes from the Library archive and verified them against the inventory record. A read-only Gmail search and full-thread fetch also recovered the matching 16 Oct job description. The private bytes, exact digest, screenshot, message body and generated output were not copied into the repository. Exact screenshot identifiers, attachment names, Library paths, file hashes, full JD text and resume content are intentionally excluded from this public repository.

The screenshot evidence recorded a job-post attachment shortly before the 17:28 Chicago response. The response described an old 98% target that was not reached after automatic repair. That historical explanation is preserved as evidence of what the user was told, not as the current delivery policy: the 6 Nov owner-approved WhatsApp policy supersedes the old 98% hard hold.

The source/JD review separated preferred examples from mandatory requirements, distinguished similarly named credentials, treated platform preferences as unverified unless supported by the selected source or explicit first-person confirmation, and excluded section headings from the keyword denominator. The exact terms and personal source facts are withheld. No live numeric match score is claimed without the generated output DOCX and its frozen scoring set.

### Current policy and unresolved hard wall

The 6 Nov owner-approved policy remains authoritative. A completed, readable DOCX below 95% may be sent with gaps disclosed; 70–94.9% is a clean pass only when supported coverage is at least 95%; below 70% is not a clean pass but may still be sent with gaps disclosed. Incomplete, skills-only, failed, unreadable or identity-mismatched output still uses the selected same-account fallback. The approved initial no-provider fallback is limited to the exact selected same-account original, labelled NOT TAILORED. A failed swipe-reply refinement sends no file and preserves the last delivered version.

The generated output DOCX, R2 object/version and request key, webhook trace, Meta message ID, and signed delivered/read receipt remain missing. The Vercel Hobby runtime-log API retains one hour; the historical 17 Oct 22:20–22:40Z request was rejected as outside retention. The read-only Supabase resume_documents query returned no rows for 17–20 Oct, and ai_workflow_runs has zero rows. No R2 connector is available. A later library DOCX with similar keywords is not correlated and is not accepted as the 17 Oct output.

No historical replay, new model call, R2 mutation, WhatsApp send or delivery claim. If the exact output and signed receipt cannot be recovered from an authorized R2/webhook export, preserve the historical outcome as unverified. Direct platform experience and preferred credentials require explicit evidence or owner confirmation; do not infer them.
