# WhatsApp resume hold — exact source recovery and evidence boundary

Updated: 10 November 2026. Method: read-only Library, Gmail, GitHub and database review plus local DOCX metadata/text inspection. No model call, real email, WhatsApp send, R2 write, or production mutation was performed.

## Recovered 17 October incident

The Library screenshot `1792276118790.jpeg` was created at `2026-10-17T22:28:39Z` (5:28 PM America/Chicago). It shows the M Fit WhatsApp thread:

- At about 5:25 PM, a Security Engineer – Risk & Controls job post and a five-page, 28 KB Word file named `Eshwar Cyber resume).docx` were submitted.
- At 5:28 PM, the bot replied: “The rewrite did not reach your 98% coverage target after automatic repair. I have held the file.”
- The visible missing-term list was `ccsp`, `cism`, `crisc`, `cisa`, `canton`, `sol`, `specialty`, `attributes`.

### Original resume bytes recovered

The exact input DOCX was recovered from the Library archive `Kompas_JEshwar44_Organized_Originals.zip`, member `J_Eshwar_44/General Security/Eshwar Cyber resume).docx`. It is 27,724 bytes and its SHA-256 is `aaa10a967b98cfed74d00b9529a95da074d6b4a6e704f1276c7e1b0d53cc7712`, matching the resume inventory record for that exact path. This is the original source file, not a generated output.

### Full job description recovered

The complete JD is present in Gmail thread `1a1464393628992f`, subject “Fwd: Looking 5+ Years || Security Engineer – Risk & Controls || Atlanta/GA (Onsite)”, received `2026-10-16T19:49:07Z`; the forwarded message is dated 17 October 2026 at 1:14 AM India time. Its title, location, contract type and opening requirements match the screenshot.

The JD requires a bachelor's degree; 5+ years in cybersecurity, technology risk, information security, risk management or controls governance; risk assessments and control evaluations; remediation through closure; NIST, ISO 27001, CIS Controls or COBIT; AWS/Azure/GCP; IAM, secrets, encryption and key management; audit/compliance support; and analytical, problem-solving and communication skills.

Preferred items include blockchain, smart contracts, cryptography and DLT platforms (Ethereum, Hyperledger Besu, Canton, Solana, Polygon); SSDLC/DevSecOps; vulnerability management/security testing; Archer, ServiceNow GRC and MetricStream; risk metrics/dashboards/executive reporting; CI/CD and cloud-native controls; CISSP/CISM/CRISC/CISA/CCSP; and AWS Security Specialty.

## Evidence classification of the eight screenshot terms

- `CCSP`, `CISM`, `CRISC`, `CISA`, and `AWS Security Specialty` are certifications. The current canonical keyword pipeline intentionally excludes certifications from match targets and removes certifications absent from the source. Do not add them to raise coverage.
- `Canton` and `Solana` are preferred blockchain platforms. The recovered source resume does not show them; they remain unsupported and must not be written as candidate experience.
- `sol` is not a separate JD skill. The full JD says `Solana`; do not count the truncated fragment separately.
- `attributes` does not appear in the recovered JD as a skill or qualification. It is generic extraction noise and must not hold a resume below its target.

A source-backed regression in this PR adds `sol` and `attributes` to the generic/non-skill filter and tests the incident's certification and preferred-platform boundaries. It does not lower evidence gates or add unsupported skills.

## Important source conflict — owner reconciliation required

The recovered source DOCX contains education, employment-date and credential claims that conflict with the owner-confirmed profile already available in prior conversations. The conflict affects the JD's required 5+ years and some credentials. Do not count the conflicting dates, tenure or credentials as confirmed experience, merge the two timelines, or rewrite them until the owner reconciles the source. The file is evidence of what was uploaded, not proof that every claim is current and verified.

A separate Library file named `Eshwar_Resume-226.docx` is not accepted as the incident output: its hash is different, its core document timestamps predate the incident, and there is no request ID, R2 key or Meta receipt linking it to this run.

## Current policy and release state

The old 98% hard WhatsApp hold is superseded by the owner-approved 6 November channel policy in `src/lib/whatsapp-resume-acceptance.ts` and `docs/research/whatsapp-scored-rewrite-2026-11-06.md`:

- Web downloads retain the strict 95% raw-JD-overlap gate.
- WhatsApp may send a completed, readable 70–94.9% raw-overlap DOCX with disclosed gaps when supported coverage is at least 95% and all clean-pass checks hold.
- A finished readable result below 70% may be sent with gaps disclosed, but is not a clean pass.
- Incomplete, skills-only, unreadable, failed or identity-mismatched rewrites use the selected same-account resume fallback.
- Unsupported experience, credentials, employers, dates and metrics are never invented.

PR #267's DOCX body/header/footer/hyperlink identity repair is already merged in master. The current canonical production alias `job-dashboard-fawn.vercel.app` was independently verified READY at `51cb716393efb1f54cdc6173c8e6b7ee6f034241` on deployment `dpl_G92eEx6vGFhgfstAocq9jkGKm6i9`. That proves the later source is deployed, not that the historical WhatsApp run succeeded.

## Remaining blockers and acceptance

1. The original DOCX and full JD are now recovered, but the generated output for this exact run is still missing.
2. The per-run R2 object key, webhook/request correlation ID, Meta message ID and signed delivery/read receipt are unavailable.
3. iZap currently has no connected WhatsApp number and returns no matching chat/message history for the incident. The original thread cannot be replayed through iZap.
4. The source DOCX conflicts with previously confirmed profile facts. Owner reconciliation is required before any experience/tenure claim is used.
5. No live WhatsApp send or authenticated device test was performed. Historical delivery remains unverified.

Next: keep the source-backed filter/test change in review; finish its exact-head CI. After the owner reconciles the conflicting source facts and an authorized output/trace is available, run a local exact-source replay and report raw overlap, supported coverage, unsupported requirements and document integrity separately. Do not restore the old 98% hard hold or send a real WhatsApp test without explicit authorization.


## 10 November 2026 — source-boundary regression released

PR #273 merged from exact head `5b6ad44a2f0bdea15678ecc9ea5b6469a6212463` as `a66c108bff6175149c4aadd882ab11128445b8cc`. The full CI run 42761112788 and Kompas baseline 42761112810 both completed SUCCESS. Production deployment `dpl_7gjdfRFeLjqcPdVC52NkaEatugKA` is READY at the exact merge SHA and independently confirmed on the canonical alias `job-dashboard-fawn.vercel.app`.

The deployed change excludes the screenshot-only `sol` and `specialty` fragments and generic `attributes` noise from match targets. It preserves supported NIST/ISO/AWS/Azure terms, keeps certifications and unsupported preferred Canton/Solana platforms out of candidate claims, and adds explicit source-fact conflict rules: conflicting education, employment dates, tenure or credential status stay unresolved until the candidate corrects them; JD requirements and years of experience are never candidate evidence.

This is source-backed code and deployment evidence only. It does not prove a 98% live match, exact historical replay, DOCX delivery or Meta handset delivery. The generated output, R2 key, webhook correlation ID, Meta message ID and signed delivery/read receipt remain unavailable. The source DOCX conflicts with owner-confirmed profile facts and requires reconciliation before any affected claim is used. No model call, real email, WhatsApp send, R2 write or production mutation was performed. The old 98% hard hold remains superseded by the 6 Nov channel-specific policy.

Next: reconcile the source facts and obtain the exact output/trace before an authorized replay; then verify document integrity and delivery separately. Do not send a live WhatsApp test without explicit authorization.
